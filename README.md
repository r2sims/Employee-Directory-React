# Employee-Directory-React

## Overview

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. For this assignment I was required to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Useage

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.
